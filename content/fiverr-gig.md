## Gig Description

---
**Get a fully personalized OpenClaw AI agent configuration — delivered in under 2 hours.**

OpenClaw is the fastest-growing personal AI assistant framework (featured on Wired, Reddit, ProductHunt). But setting it up right takes hours of trial and error.

I'll do it for you.

**What you get:**
✅ Custom configuration files built around YOUR goals
✅ Agent personality tuned to your work style
✅ Proactive tasks that actually matter to you
✅ Step-by-step installation guide (works even if you're not technical)

**Why buy this instead of DIY?**
The default OpenClaw setup is generic. My configs are tailored — your agent will proactively check your calendar, monitor your Stripe revenue, scan for opportunities in your industry, and send you daily reports. Out of the box.

**Delivery is instant.** Once you fill out the requirements form, your custom pack is generated and delivered within 1–4 hours depending on package.

**This is a digital product.** You download the files, drop them in your OpenClaw workspace folder, and your agent is live.
